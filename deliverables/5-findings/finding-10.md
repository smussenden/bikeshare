## Finding 10

#### _Question:_ How did the metro shutdown in March 15th, 2016 affected the capital bikeshare ridership?

 _Answer:_ The heatmap grid generated for this analysis shows that during the week, the morning rush hour (7 a.m. - 9 a.m.) and the evening rush hour (5 p.m. - 7 p.m.) are by far the busiest times of day, with lighter traffic in between.  The opposite is true on Saturdays and Sunday, with a larger concentration of ridership between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.

Generating similar grids for registered users and casual users shows interesting usage patterns.  Registered users show much higher ridership during the week during rush hour.  Casual users show much higher ridership on weekends.
