# Question 6
What hours of the day and days of the week do most rides occur? And is there any difference in how rides by registered and casual users are distributed?

#Answer 6
The heatmap grid generated for this analysis shows that during the week, the morning rush hour (7 a.m. - 9 a.m.) and the evening rush hour (5 p.m. - 7 p.m.) are by far the busiest times of day, with lighter traffic in between.  The opposite is true on Saturdays and Sunday, with a larger concentration of ridership between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.

Generating similar grids for registered users and casual users shows interesting usage patterns.  Registered users show much higher ridership during the week during rush hour.  Casual users show much higher ridership on weekends.
