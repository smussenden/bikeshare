# Question 7
How do different types of users -- registered vs. casual -- differ in usage by season?  
# Answer 7
The distribution of rides in each season is much more evenly distributed for registered users than it is for casual users.  

A much higher percentage of rides by casual users come in the summer and spring.  For registered users, rides are move evenly distributed between fall, summer and spring.
