## Finding 9

#### _Question:_ Amongst the most used and least used stations, are there any patterns about usage by registered users versus casual users?

_Answer:_ Yes. At 18 out of 20 of the most used stations, the majority of rides are taken by registered users.  The two stations where there were more casual users than registered users are both in tourist heavy areas -- the Lincoln Memorial and the FDR Memorial on the National Mall. And at most of these top 20 stations, the gap between registered and casual rides was very large. For example, at the Eastern Market station, 86 percent of rides were taken by registered users.
