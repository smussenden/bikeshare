_Answer_: Between 2011 and 2016, ridership over the seasons followed the same pattern, where in Summer had the highest ridership followed closely by Spring, then Fall and lastly Winter. This makes sense since people would prefer riding during warmer weathers as it is especially unpleasant to ride a bike in extreme cold and slightly more dangerous to ride on the roads.
