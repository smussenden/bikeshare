## Visualization Explanation for 30_minutes_trips_plot.png

#### _Question_: There are two main types of riders who use the Capital Bikeshare system: registered members who buy monthly or annual memberships and casual users who buy single-trip, single-day or week-long passes.  How does the ridership behavior of these two groups differ?  Specifically, what percentage of registered members take trips under 30 minutes, avoiding paying a penalty for taking a longer ride?  And how does that compare to the percentage for casual members?

_Answer_: Registered users are more likely to take a sub-30 minute trip than casual users. As this graph shows, we found that 92.8 percent of trips by registered users were for less than 30 minutes, compared to 59.8 percent of casual users. Since this graph includes the data for the ridership patterns for all quarters from 2010 to 2017 we can be confident in stating that the registered riders are more likely to use a bike for short trips of less than thirty minutes.
