#### _Question_: How do ridership patterns vary by season? 

![Ridership patters by seasons](plots/season_trips_plot.png?raw=true "Seasonal Ridership")

_Answer_: Between 2011 and 2016, ridership was substantially higher in the Summer (4.99 million rides) and Spring (4.53 million rides) than in the Fall (3.51 million rides) and Winter (2.30 million rides). This makes sense. More tourists visit Washington in the summer.  And it's especially unpleasant to ride a bike in extreme cold.  From this graph, we see that users of the Capital Bikeshare program tend to ride bikes during the warmer seasons of the year, and ride less frequently during colder seasons.
