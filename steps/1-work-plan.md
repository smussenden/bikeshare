#### DRAFT RESEARCH QUESTIONS

*   How do ridership patterns vary by season?  (**Audience**: Capital Bikeshare and Washington, D.C. transportation planners).
*   How have ridership patterns changed over the last five years? (**Audience**: Capital Bikeshare and Washington, D.C. transportation planners). 
*   By examining the most popular combination of beginning and end stations, and by determining the most efficient route between those stations using the Google Maps API, can we determine whether Washington, D.C.’s current bike path infrastructure matches the most efficient route? (**Audience**: Washington, D.C. transportation planners).
*   Are the bikeshare stations located in areas that easily connect with the city’s public transportation system, and how heavily are those used? (**Audience**: Capital Bikeshare and Washington, D.C. transportation planners).
*   To what degree are cars hitting people riding bikes around Capital Bikeshare stations? (**Audience**: Capital Bikeshare, Washington, D.C. transportation planners, Capital Bikeshare users, police).
*   To what degree has Capital Bikeshare ridership affected -- or been affected by -- ridership on the city’s public transportation network?  For example, as ridership on the Metro system -- which has been plagued by maintenance and safety problems -- has declined, has there been a correlative increase in ridership on Capital Bikeshare?  Can we look at how specific outages of a specific Metro line affected Bikeshare use in a particular location? (**Audience**: Capital Bikeshare, Washington, D.C. transportation planners).
*   In which areas of the city is the Capital Bikeshare program less popular, as measured by number of trips originating from a given station? (**Audience**: Capital Bikeshare). 
*   In which areas of the city is Capital Bikeshare extremely popular, as measured by the number of trips to a given station? (**Audience**: Capital Bikeshare, specifically concerning adding new stations or expanding existing stations, expanding the “Corral” program to prevent stations from filling up with bikes). 
*   What proportion of members -- who get rides under 30-minutes free -- are going over that time period, incurring a per-trip charge? (**Audience**: Capital Bikeshare, considering whether to raise or lower the standard)?
*   Typically, Capital Bikeshare bikes are used for short trips.  But to what degree are users going on long trips in the systems, which we can determine by trips to the most geographically isolated bikeshare locations? (**Audience**: Capital Bikeshare, Washington, D.C. transportation planners).
*   Can we uncover the “secret lives” of individual bikes, by measuring how a single bike moves across the city every day for a single year? (**Audience**: people interested in neat things).
*   How are people using Capital Bikeshare late at night, to get home from bars, by looking at trips between 1:30 a.m. and 2:30 a.m. in areas of the city that are centers of late-night activity? (**Audience**: Capital Bikeshare, transportation planners).
*  What stations are the most consistently used, and what stations are the most consistently underused? (**Audience**: Capital Bikeshare, city transportation planners).

## PROJECTED EFFORT ALLOCATION

In order to ensure everyone has an equal chance to develop their skills with data acquisition, data cleaning, data analysis and interpretation, data visualization, writing and GitHub repo management, we plan each take a 25 percent share of the work on each task.  

## TARGET AUDIENCE FOR ANALYSIS

Capital Bikeshare; Washington, D.C. transportation planners; Capital Bikeshare users; Police.
