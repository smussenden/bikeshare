# **INFM 600 Bikeshare**

#### Draft Research Questions

*   How do ridership patterns vary by seasons?  (**Audience**: Capital BikeShare and D.C. transportation planners).
*   How have ridership patterns changed over the last five years? (**Audience**: Capital BikeShare and D.C. transportation planners). 
*   By examining the most popular combination of beginning and end stations, and by determining the most efficient route between those stations using the Google Maps API, can we determine whether Washington, D.C.’s current bike path infrastructure matches the most efficient route? (**Audience**: D.C. transportation planners.  City government planners need to know the impact of the bikeshare program on traffic flow in the city.)
*   Are the bikeshare stations located in areas that easily connect with the city’s public transportation system, and how heavily are those used? (**Audience**: Capital BikeShare and D.C. transportation planners?)
*   To what degree are people being hit by cars while riding bikes clustered around Capital BikeShare stations? (**Audience**: Capital BikeShare, transportation planners, users, police).
*   To what degree has Capital BikeShare ridership affected or been affected by ridership on the city’s public transportation network?  For example, as ridership on the Metro system -- which has been plagued by maintenance and safety problems and declining ridership -- has there been a correlative increase in ridership on Capital BikeShare?  Can we look at how specific outages of a specific line affected BikeShare use in a particular location? (**Audience**: Capital BikeShare, transportation planners, users, police)
*   In which areas of the city is the Capital BikeShare program less popular, as measured by number of trips originating from a given station? (**Audience**: Capital BikeShare development of marketing materials, discount programs). 
*   In which areas of the city is Capital BikeShare extremely popular, as measured by number of trips to a given station? (**Audience**: Capital BikeShare considering adding new stations or expanding existing stations, expanding the “Corral” program to prevent stations from filling up with bikes). 
*   What proportion of members -- who get rides under 30-minutes free -- are going over that time period, incurring a per-trip charge? (**Audience**: Capital BikeShare, considering whether to raise or lower the standard)?
*   Typically, Capital BikeShare bikes are used for short trips.  But to what degree are users going on long trips in the systems, by examining rides to the most geographically isolated bikeshare locations? (**Audience**: Capital BikeShare, transportation planners).
*   Can we uncover the “secret lives” of individual bikes, by measuring how a single bike moves across the city every day for a single year? (**Audience**: people interested in neat things).
*   How are people using Capital BikeShare late at night, to get home from bars, by looking at trips between 1:30 a.m. and 2:30 a.m. in areas of the city that are centers of late-night activity? (**Audience**: Capital BikeShare, transportation planners.
*  What stations are the most consistently used, and what stations are the most consistently underused? (**Audience**: Capital BikeShare, city transportation planners).

## PROJECTED EFFORT ALLOCATION

In order to ensure everyone has an equal chance to develop their skills with data acquisition, data cleaning, data analysis and interpretation, data visualization, writing and GitHub repo management, we plan each take a 25 percent share of the work on each task.
