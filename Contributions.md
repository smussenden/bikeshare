## Group Project Contributions:


At the outset of the project, we decided that each team member would play a key role during each step of the process. 

* During the cleaning phase, we reviewed metadata and each were assigned to clean, standardize and combine into a single file 25 percent of the quarterly data files.  We then jointly worked together to merge them into one large file, and merge them with geocoordinate data. 

* During the analysis phase, we all brainstormed questions to answer using the data.  We each then took a handful of questions and individually performed the analysis, working together when we got stuck on problems.  

* During the visualization phase, we each generated a plot or plots using ggplot to visualize the data produced by the question we selected.  

* And in compiling the final report, GitHub repo and presentation slides, we each played a role in writing and editing the documents.
