**Bikeshare**   
#Plot

## **Question 2: ** There are two main types of riders who use the Capital Bikeshare system: registered members who buy monthly or annual memberships and casual users who buy single-trip, single-day or week-long passes.  How does the ridership behavior of these two groups differ?  Specifically, what percentage of registered members take trips under 30 minutes, avoiding paying a penalty for taking a longer ride?  And how does that compare to the percentage for casual members?
